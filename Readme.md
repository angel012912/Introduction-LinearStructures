## Description
This activities were part of the subject "Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms" where the main objective was to understand the functionality of the Linear Data Structures and their implementation.

## Main Learnings 
* Simple Linked Node
* Double Linked Node
* Queue 
* Stack
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Class Definition and Implementation
* Pointers
* Data pass by Value
* Data pass by Reference

## Installation
* Make sure to have installed a C++ enviroment 
* Download the repository on your local machine
* Run the command <code>./main</code> on the terminal located at the root path of the project or just open the <code>main.exe</code> file
